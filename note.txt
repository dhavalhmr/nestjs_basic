NestJs is built around the strong design pattern commonly known as Dependency injection. Dependency injection is inspired by Angular things providers, middleware, components, and services will be found in Angular


NestJs uses built in expressjs under the hood but we can also use fastify


--------------------NestJS--------------------
Pipes can be used for request validation 
Custom pipe validation can be made also




nestJs---incoming request cycle:
1.incoming request
2.middleware
3.guard
4.interceptor
5.pipe
6.controller
7.interceptor
8.response


nestJs--application lifecycle events:
There are three phases : 
A. Initializing
B. Running
C. Terminating


A.======Initializing======
Stage 1 - Nest Core boostraping(Boostraping starts)

Stage 2 - Initializing modules 
after initializing modules we can call onModulesInit() methods

Stage 3 - On Application bootstrap
After all modules initialized, but before initializing for connection

Once the application bootstrap is completed then nestJs application gets listen on particular port this stage is called Start listener

B.======Running======
Application Running Phase where it is fine

C.======Terminating======
Stage.1 - onModuleDestroy
It destroy each modules and child controller & providers

Stage.2 - beforeApplicationShutdown
In this stage all modules has been destroy and things we can do the things after destroying modules

Stage.3 - Stop listeners 
No more new http request will be accepted

Stage.4 - onApplicationShutdown
In this stage all existing listener has been shutted down

Stage.5 - Process exit
In this process nodejs process gets exited

we can see how much request per seconds completed by express and fastify in below website:

like we are making services in NestJS
same we can do the things in fastify but here will be plugins(third party plugins or custom plugin made by us)


if the project so going big like it is going to continuously added a feature then we can go prefer fastify or nestJs
