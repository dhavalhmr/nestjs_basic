NestJs is built around the strong design pattern commonly known as Dependency injection. Dependency injection is inspired by Angular things providers, middleware, components, and services will be found in Angular


NestJs uses built in expressjs under the hood but we can also use fastify


--------------------NestJS--------------------
Pipes can be used for request validation 
Custom pipe validation can be made also




nestJs---incoming request cycle:
1.incoming request
2.middleware
3.guard
4.interceptor
5.pipe
6.controller
7.interceptor
8.response


--------------------NestJS--------------------





we can see how much request per seconds completed by express and fastify in below website:

like we are making services in NestJS
same we can do the things in fastify but here will be plugins(third party plugins or custom plugin made by us)


if the project so going big like it is going to continuously added a feature then we can go prefer fastify or nestJs
